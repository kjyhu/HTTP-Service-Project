/**1. The different programs communicate with each to make changes in the backend of my music app because they can modify the app
 * without actually having to open the file itself instead, you can retrive the link on backend and make the changes on the backend.
 * Get is the basic of the page where it is what the user see on the page. Post adds a new genre to the genres array and is being displayed
 * throguh get. Put updates a genre that's in the genres array based on the id. Delete deletes a genre in the genres array based on the id
 * and returns an error if the id doesn't exist.
 * 2. I've learned that you can edit the app from the backend instead of actually editting the document and saving it and reuploading it
 * which is a little more more time consuming.
 * 3. This project could be further extended by requiring more other HTTP requests or other backend services.
